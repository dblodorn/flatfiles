# üìÅ FlatFiles üìÅ
Blank WP theme for API Connection. This is just for you to connect to the CMS and access your data via JSON! In fact all you really need are the functions.php file and the public/library/custom-post-type.php - so you can use custom post types. All the other stuff is just sugar if you want to play around and make a theme you can look at...

See the API output on this page ‚õì: [https://flatfiles.info/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/12](https://flatfiles.info/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/12)

## WP Plugins you need:
+ [WP REST API (2.0)](http://v2.wp-api.org/)
+ [WP REST API Cache](https://github.com/airesvsg/wp-rest-api-cache)
+ [Advanced Custom Fields PRO](https://github.com/wp-premium/advanced-custom-fields-pro)
+ [ACF to REST API](https://github.com/airesvsg/acf-to-rest-api)

### Nice to have but not necessary:
+ [CloudFlare Flexible SSL](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cloudflare-flexible-ssl/)
+ [EWWW Image Optimizer](https://ewww.io/)
+ [WordPress HTTPS](https://github.com/Mvied/wordpress-https)
+ [WP-Markdown](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-markdown/)
+ [Duplicate Post](https://wordpress.org/plugins/duplicate-post/)

I recommend routing your site through [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) so you have free SSL.

## Utilities:
If you use FTP...

    # using vinyl ftp through gulp you can do an easy deploy by creating a file called deploy-credentials.json in the root directory.
    # this file should have the following info:

    {
      "user": "username",
      "password": "password",
      "host": "your.host",
      "remoteFolder": "/uploadfolder/"
    }

    # Don't forget to make sure deploy-credentials.json in included in .gitignore!

## Webpack / Build:
This project uses jade-php (or pug) & sass, so if you want to extend the theme you can start there.  
Gulp Tasks are trigerred through webpack config.

    # install dependencies
    npm install

    # Watch your files
    npm run watch

    # build for production with minification & deploy via ftp
    npm run build

    # You Should probably run
    gulp jade
    gulp move

    #to move unwatched files (like functions.php and the library folder) type
    gulp move

#### HAVE FUN
And btw, using this in conjunction with [VueJs](https://vuejs.org/) is awesome... üòé

#### Here's an example vue 1.x component using Vue-Resource:

    <template lang="jade">
      ul.links
        li(v-for="links in work.acf.website_archive")
          a.project-link.link(v-link="links.website_link" target="_blank") {{links.website_title}}
          .archive-copy {{{links.website_description}}}
    </template>

    <script>
      import $ from 'jquery'
      export default {
        data () {
          return {
            work: {}
          }
        },
        route: {
          canReuse: false,
            activate: function() {
            
            this.$http.get('https://flatfiles.info/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/12').then (
            function (data) {
              this.$set('work', data.json());
            },
            function (data) {
              alert('Failed to load data');
            }); 
          
          }
        }
      }
    </script>

    <style lang="sass?indentedSyntax">
      #css
        background-color: blue
    </style>
